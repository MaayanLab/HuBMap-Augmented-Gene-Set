## Data
This folder contains the augmented gene set text files. Each organ text file may contain empty text. The reason for this was that the original gene set list generated from [ASCT+B Table](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf-asct-reporter/) is still being curated and is in a draft form. Meaning some organs has ASCT+B tables that does not specify cell type or gene marker.
