## Data
This respository contains the augmented gene set text files. Each organ may contain empty text. The reason for this was that the original gene set list generated from [ASCT+B Table](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf-asct-reporter/) is still being curated and is in a draft form. Meaning some organs has ASCT+B tables does specify cell type or gene marker.
